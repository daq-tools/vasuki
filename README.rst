Etymology
*********

Kurma_ is one of the avatars of Vishnu_. He appears in the form of a tortoise
or turtle to support the foundation of the cosmos, while the gods and demons
churn the cosmic ocean with the help of serpent Vasuki_ to produce the nectar
of immortality.

Vasuki is a serpent king, occasionally coiling around Kurma's or Shiva's
neck, who blessed and wore him as an ornament. He is described as having
a gem called Nagamani on his head.
